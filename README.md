**Tasks:**

**Data Preprocessing:**
Explore and understand the dataset.
Handle missing values, outliers, and data cleaning tasks.
Perform analysis to gain insights into attribute relationships.
**Regression:**
Build and evaluate a regression model to predict house prices.
Fine-tune model parameters for improved performance.
Test the trained model on the test file of the dataset.
**Classification:**
Identify categories for converting price values into appropriate classes.
Preprocess data for classification and apply various classification models.
Evaluate and compare model performance using relevant metrics.
**Combined Analysis:**
Explore the relationship between house prices and identified classes.
Analyze feature contributions to house classification.
Visualize results for a comprehensive analysis.
Note: This project provides a hands-on opportunity to implement machine learning techniques for both regression and classification tasks, along with data preprocessing and analysis skills.
